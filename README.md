Images_Project
==============

This is a CS61B class project assigned by professor Jonathan Shewchuk in Spring '14.

Two image processing algorithoms (blurring & edge detection) have been implemented that can operate on color images. Using libraries to read and write files in the TIFF image format, image files are compressed if there are many adjacent pixels of the same color, that is, they compressed into a form called a run-length encoding. Functions that are able to convert an image into a run-length encoding and back have also been implemented.
